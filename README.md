# ipdsb

* ipdsb - cc licensed, library and exchange of DNA and Seed Samples
* ipdsb - distributed exchange and knowledge peering for community seed banks

## Lets build a github for DNA, seeds, etc.
* Decentralized/distributed
* interplanetary
* acting local and universal

Distribution tool to peer information and Seed/DNS freely between networks of networks of seed, spore and information exchanges

* Gathering, preserving and Improving knowledge of the ecology of species.

* Postal or direct local coordinated exchange of seeds
* In the future, hopefully sometime soon, digital, real time

* Pushing for Crowdsourced sequencing of DNA
* Building DB of all DNA - Capture all living beings before they go extinct
* Make high quality seed material available for conservation, research and restoration. [0]
* Maybe help fight hunger and provide farmers with more knowledge and optimized local seed sources
* Create Universal open mapping of "Tree of life" [1]
