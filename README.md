# ipdsb

* ipdsb - cc liscensed db exchange of DNA and Seed Samples
* ipdsb - distribiuted exchange and knowlage peering for comunity seed banks

Lets build a github for DNA, seeds, etc.
Decentralized of cours, interplanetary distribiuted, acting local and universal

Distribiution tool to peer freely between networks of networks of seed, spore and information exchanges

* Gathering and perseving knowlage of seeds and biofactors
* Postal or local cordinated exchange of seeds
* In the future hopefully sometime soon, digital, realtime
* Pushing for Crowdsource sequencing of DNA and builing DB of dna of all living beeings before they die out
* Universal open mapping of "Tree of life"
